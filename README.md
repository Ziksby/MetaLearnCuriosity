# Meta-learning Curiosity Algorithms

## Overview
This repository implements curiosity algorithms for reinforcement learning (RL), including Random Network Distillation and BYOL-Explore. Currently a work in progress, with a focus on integrating meta-learning for curiosity.

**Note:** This project is based on [PureJAXRL](https://github.com/luchris429/purejaxrl/tree/main).
